# FCMVRP_OptimizationAlgorithm

This is the Optimization Algorithm used in the Robotics Master Thesis (Matlab version). The entire thesis *.pdf* can be found here
**https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B_685PmY--1MYi_28N_-jJIomqYG0k79/view?usp=sharing**.

Refer to the "**Formulations and algorithms for the multiple depot, fuel-constrained, multiple vehicle routing problem**" article *https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7526691* for further information.

 To run the code insert the desired Targets and Charging Stations coordinates in the main file *"single_drone_battery_tsp_opt.m"* and then run it.
 It will be displayed to insert the inspection time that the drones will spend visiting the targets.
