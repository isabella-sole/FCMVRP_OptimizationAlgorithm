# FCMVRP_OptimizationAlgorithm

This is the Optimization algorithm used in the Robotics Master Thesis (Matlab version). The entire thesis work can be found in the "*Robotics Master Thesis*" git repository.

Refer to the "**Formulations and algorithms for the multiple depot, fuel-constrained, multiple vehicle routing problem.pdf**" article for further information.

 To run the code insert the desired Targets and Charging Stations coordinates in the main file *"single_drone_battery_tsp_opt"* and then run it.
 It will be displayed to insert the inspection time that the drones will spend to visit each target.
